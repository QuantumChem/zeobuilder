This is how the plugins are organized:

- core: 
    everything of zeobuilder that does not know about atoms and molecules
- molecular:
    features related to atoms and molecules
- builder:
    all specialized molecular building features
    
If you are planning to add a bunch of plugins that deserve a separate directory,
please go ahead. Do not make a mess of it.
