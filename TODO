TODO LISTS
==========


TODO core
---------

### User interface

    * Rewrite the invalid messages in the dialogs
    * default values for fieldsdialog and last used values
    * A history for the selection filters (saved in a config file)


### New/updated dialog fields

    * A nicer color field (with colors)


### Implementation

    * Python 2.4 dependencies:
        - Use generator expression where possible (sum, min, max, tuple, list, dict, enumerate)
        - Use sets instead of lists where uniqueness and fast "x in set"
          operations are required (TODO: CONVERT LIST TO SET)
        - check all sort methods of sequences and use key and reverse where
          possible
    * Some ideas
        - separate the common parts of InteractiveRotateObject and
          InteractiveTranslateObject
	* Code documentation + revision of each module
 


TODO before first release
-------------------------

### Priority

	* import al the (remaining) old zeobuilder code in this new tree in the form
	  of plugins (and as external modules).
	    - dialog field that can select between a standard and a user value
	      (for the radius and the color of an atom)
	  	- databases and tables as model objects (in folder)
	  	- import and export database
	  	- fsi that also depends and external coordinates
	  	- fsi that rotates and translates like a frame
	  	- an action button who's sensitivity depends on the selection cache
	  	- that atoms that are candidates for connections in the connections
	  	  scanner must be made configurable. (a la selection filter)
        - field ElementSimple and popup ElementSimplePopup


### Bugs

    * write_pov on periodic systems is broken
	* Correct face culling for inverted objects
    * apply lint tools on code to find extra bugs
    * do manual tests in addition to the unit tests.


### New/Updated actions

    * Create an action for the transformations that the scanresults dialog does
    * Action for changing visualization of sets of atoms and bonds (children)
        -> should be done maybe with representations
    * Invert action that pops an inversion center dialog


### New/Updated model objects

    * Atom: dot visualization
    * Bond: 
        - alternative visualization for double, triple and hybrid
        - lines visualization
        - parameterize stick width
        - menu actions to make style changes on groups


### Speed optimizations

    * Try to reduce the number of invalidate calls
    * What makes unframe so slow? (tip: when applying unframe fast enough after
      each other, this delay goes away) -> profiling
    * Optimize the export pov files for rendering time


### Design and implementation changes

    * Fields: read/write(instance) -> read/write(attribute) ??
    * Simplify the transformation calculus
    * cursor.execute with parameters for optimized large data transfer
    * A default action associated with each node type. (double click)


### More data files with zeolite unit cells
    
    * Transform those found on the atlas of zeolite frameworks


### Non-programming

    * Define future milestones in more detail
    * Create a version numbering scheme
    * Document the source so that it is ready for automatic generation of
      reference documentation
    * Create a user documentation with howto's
    * Create a zeobuilder website: apache, a good content manager using modern
      technologies
        - a phpBB forum (Installation, Tips and Howto's, Applications,
          Feature request, ...)
        - darcs browser
        - screen shots
        - downloads + release notes
        - news
        - about
        - features (future and history)
        - links
        - plugin database, without warranty
        - documentation (user + implementation)
        - Bugs, the bugtracker
        - FAQ
        

### Marketing
    
    * Publication in JCC
    * post on mailinglists: 
        gentoo-science
        pygtk
        ccl
    * post on forums
    * talks and posters



TODO following releases
-----------------------

### Big items

    * A built in python command line
        - logical operations on SavedSelections
        - define plugins and selected instances as locals
    * Full support for periodic an symmetric unit cells
        - implementation of all two dimensional and three dimensional
          crystal lattices
    * An interactive feedback connection to/from computational tools


### New/Update actions

    * Dragging between two zeobuilder processes
    * Dragging multiple selections + Copydrag function
    * MergeAtomsConnectedWithMinimiser
    * Interactive Action for creating connections of any type
    * Interactive WalkTrough
    * Small molecule creation tool (ala Z-matrix but easier and better)
    * More import and export filters (connection to openbabel)
    * LookAt Action (space bar)
    * Mirror/Reflection transformations

        
### New model objects

	* planes and angles    
    * the RepresentationFrame: a frame that interprets it's children and
      gives an alternative visualization based on these children (goal is to
      eliminate the use of abstractions)
        -> This must be linked with the TransformedImage object
           (saves memory)
    * The camera modelobject / Multiple views
