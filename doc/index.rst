Introduction
============

Zeobuilder is a user-friendly GUI toolkit for the construction of advanced
molecular models.

* Zeobuilder is **free** software. One can use and redistribute it under the
  conditions of the GNU GPL license version 3. The license text is available at
  the GNU website, but we also maintain a local copy of the GPL_License_v3.

* Zeobuilder is **extensible**. The core program of Zeobuilder is relatively small.
  Most of the features are implemented via a plugin framework. A plugin consists
  of a simple text file (python code) that needs no further compilation. It is
  easy to write new plugins that do exactly what you are interested in.

* Zeobuilder contains several **advanced tools** to build, align, manipulate
  and analyze molecular structures.

* Zeobuilder describes a molecular model with **a hierarchical data-structure of
  reference frames**. This facilitates operations on models at different levels of
  detail.
