Installation
############


Disclaimer
==========

Zeobuilder is developed and tested in modern Linux environments. The
installation instructions below are given for a Linux system only. If you want
to use Zeobuilder on other operating systems such as Windows or OSX, you should
have a minimal computer geek status to get it working. We are always interested
in hearing from your installation adventures.


MolMod dependency
=================

`MolMod <http://molmod.github.com/molmod/>`_ is a Python library used by most
Python programs developed at the CMM. It must be installed before Zeobuilder can
be used or installed. Installation and download instructions can be found in the
`molmod documentation <http://molmod.github.com/molmod/tutorial/install.html>`_.
The instructions below only work of the MolMod package is installed.


External dependencies
=====================

Some software packages should be installed before Zeobuilder can be installed or
used. It is recommended to use the software package management of your Linux
distribution to install these dependencies.

The following software must be installed:

* Python 2.5, 2.6 or 2.7 (including the development files): http://www.python.org/
* Numpy >= 1.0: http://numpy.scipy.org/
* PyGTK >= 2.8: http://www.pygtk.org/
* PyOpenGL >= 2.0: http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/
* PyGTKGLExt >= 1.1.0: http://www.k-3d.org/gtkglext/Main_Page
* librsvg2 >= 2.0: http://librsvg.sourceforge.net/
* libglade2 >= 2.0: http://www.jamesh.id.au/software/libglade/
* MatPlotLib >= 1.0: http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/

Most Linux distributions can install this software with just a single terminal
command.

* Ubuntu 12.4::

    sudo apt-get install python-gtk python-opengl python-numpy python-gtkglext1 python-matplotlib

* Fedora 17::

    sudo yum install {TODO}


Installing the latest version of Zeobuilder
===========================================

The following series of commands will download the latest version of Zeobuilder,
and will then install it into your home directory. ::

    cd ~/build/
    git clone git://github.com/molmod/Zeobuilder.git
    (cd zeobuilder; ./setup.py install --home=~)

You are now ready to start using Zeobuilder!


Upgrading to the latest version of MolMod and Zeobuilder
========================================================

In case you want to upgrade Zeobuilder to the latests development version after
a previous install, then execute the following commands (in the same directory
that was originally used to install Zeobuilder)::

    cd ~/build/
    (cd molmod; git pull; rm -r ~/lib*/python/molmod*; ./setup.py install --home=~)
    (cd zeobuilder; git pull; rm -r ~/lib*/python/zeobuilder*; ./setup.py install --home=~)


Testing your installation
=========================

For the development and testing one needs to install one additional package:

* Nosetests >= 0.11: http://somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose/0.11.2/

Most Linux distributions can install this software with just a single command on
the command line by the administrator.

* Ubuntu 10.4::

    sudo apt-get install python-nose

* Debian 5::

    su -
    apt-get install python-nose
    exit

* Fedora 17::

    sudo yum install python-nose

* Suse 11.2::

    sudo zypper install python-nose

Once these dependencies are installed, execute the following commands to run the
tests::

    cd ~/build/
    cd zeobuilder
    nosetests -v

If some tests fail, post the output of the tests on the `Zeobuilder
mailing list <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/zeobuilder>`_.
