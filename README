Short description
-----------------

Zeobuilder is a GUI toolkit for the interactive construction of complex
molecular models. The objective of Zeobuilder, is to become the ultimate
molecular editor through an open and community-oriented developemnt process.
From the users point-of-view, we focus and user-friendly and efficient program,
while from the developers point-of-view, we try to make it easy to extend
Zeobuilder with new features.
