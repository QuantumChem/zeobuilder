Short description
-----------------

Zeobuilder is a GUI toolkit for the interactive construction of complex
molecular models. The objective of Zeobuilder, is to become the ultimate
molecular editor through an open and community-oriented developemnt process.
From the users point-of-view, we focus and user-friendly and efficient program,
while from the developers point-of-view, we try to make it easy to extend
Zeobuilder with new features.

More information about Zeobuilder can be found on the CMM Code website:

Software dependencies
---------------------

The following software has to be installed on your system before you can use
Zeobuilder:
  1) Python (>=2.4, <3.0): see http://www.python.org/
  2) Numpy (>=1.0.1): see http://www.scipy.org/
  3) PyGTK (>=2.8): see http://www.pygtk.org
     GTK (>=2.8): see http://www.gtk.org
  4) PyOpenGL (>=2.0): see http://pyopengl.sf.net/
     Any OpenGL implementation (this is installed by default on most machines)
  5) PyGTKGLExt and GTKGLExt: http://www.k-3d.org/gtkglext/Main_Page

You can get these dependencies from the Zeobuilder site: http://molmod.ugent.be/code/
  6) MolMod (>= 0.002)
  9) ConScan (>= 0.002)
 10) Iterative (>= 0.002)

We strongly recommend the installation of Zeobuilder on an operating system that
has a software management system that automatically installs all these
dependencies, such as Debian Linux.


How to install
--------------

There are several ways to install Zeobuilder, which are all documented
at the homepage: http://molmod.ugent.be/code/


How to get technical support
----------------------------

Technical support is availlable for all registered CMM Code users. All
information can be found at: http://molmod.ugent.be/code/


Become a registered user
------------------------

There are 5 good reasons to become a registered user:

 1.  Through your registration, we can prove that people are really using
 softwarde developed at the Center for Molecular Modeling for their 
 scientific work. This facilitates the fund-raising process and guarantees 
 the continuity of these projects.

 2. It blocks spammers from unauthorized access to all online CMM Code
 services.
 
 3. A registered user can subscribe to the CMM Code mailing lists.
 
 4. A registered user is allowed to edit the wiki pages to increase the
 visibility of his/her related work.
 
 5. Registered users are allowed to submit bugs. If time permits, we will fix
 your problems in the next bug-fix release of Zeobuilder.
