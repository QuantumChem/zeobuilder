Zeobuilder is a user-friendly GUI toolkit for the construction of advanced
molecular models. The program contains several advanced tools to build, align,
manipulate and analyze molecular structures. Most of its novel functionality is
based on a hierarchical data-structure of reference frames to represent a
molecular structure. Furthermore, Zeobuilder is extensible. The core program is
compact and nearly all of the functionality is implemented through a plug-in
framework.
