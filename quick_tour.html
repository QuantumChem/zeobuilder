<h1>Zeobuilder Quick Tour<a class="headerlink" href="#zeobuilder-quick-tour" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This page contains an (incomplete) illustrated overview of Zeobuilder&#8217;s capabilities.</p>
<div class="section" id="a-slick-user-interface">
<h2>A slick user interface<a class="headerlink" href="#a-slick-user-interface" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The user interface of Zeobuilder is kept minimalistic to encourage new users and
developers. As illustrated below, this straightforward design does not boycott
the implementation advanced and powerfull features.</p>
<div align="center" class="figure">
<img alt="_images/zeobuilder_clean_compact.png" src="_images/zeobuilder_clean_compact.png" />
<p class="caption">Figure 1: The clean and concise user interface of Zeobuilder.</p>
</div>
<p>The user interface consists of four parts:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The big frame at the right contains the 3D visualization of the molecular model</li>
<li>The top of the window hosts the menu bar that offers many functions to
manipulate/analyze the model.</li>
<li>Below the menu bar four interactive toolbar buttons are available and can be
assigned to pre-programmed short-cuts. Depending on the
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modifier_key">modifier keys</a> pressed while
working with the mouse in the 3D view, (parts of) the model are selected,
translated, rotated or the rotation center is translated.</li>
<li>The lower left part is a logical presentation of the model: It lists all
items in the model in a hierarchical fashion.</li>
</ol>
<p>The 3D view uses the OpenGL standard for rendering the model. Zeobuilder makes
extensive use of OpenGL display lists to unleash the full potential of 3D
hardware acceleration. Manipulations like rotations and translations, even for
thousands of atoms, are rendered fluently on screen.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="user-friendly">
<h2>User friendly<a class="headerlink" href="#user-friendly" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>

</li>
<li><p class="first">Arbitrary parts of the model can be cut, copied, duplicated and pasted at new
places in the model, or even in different instances of the Zeobuilder program.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Most prominent menu functions are activated via a keyboard short-cut.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Zeobuilder automatically detects which menu functions are applicable to the
current selection, and only these menu functions are enabled.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Selections in the 3D view and the logical view are always synchronized.
Depending on your situation, the one is more practical than the other.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Zeobuilder also has it&#8217;s proper file format (.zml) in which all model
information can be stored. Zeobuilder also accepts external file formats such
as the <cite>.xyz</cite> and the <cite>.pdb</cite> formats, but in the <cite>.zml</cite> format is designed to
store all information in a Zeobuilder model.</p>

<h2>Configurable<a class="headerlink" href="#configurable" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">The interactive function buttons have no definite meaning. The user can

</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Internally Zeobuilder represents all information in atomic units. This
facilitates the programming of many features. When displaying certain measures
in the user-interface, they are converted to the default units select in the
configuration dialog. When the user enters new values, a different unit can be
appended to that number, or if the unit is omitted, the default unit is
assumed.</p>

</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">When a menu-bar function requires some parameters from the user (via a dialog
box), Zeobuilder will remember the values which have been used as input during
the last session of this menu function. These data are also stored in a
configuration file, so Zeobuilder remembers them the next time you start the
program.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Some fields in the dialog boxes throughout Zeobuilder show an extra
functionality when it comes to remembering previously used values. Zeobuilder
records a history of the last 6 (or more) values. The user is free to save his
favorite presets.</p>

<li><p class="first">An elementary analysis of a molecular structure includes the measurement of
various types of internal coordinates. The &#8216;&#8217;Interactive measurement tool&#8217;&#8217;
has been developed to make this task easy. Figure 3 shows how one selects the
measurement tool. In figure 5, an example measurement is given on a zeolite
structure. Zeobuilder does not only measure the conventional bond length,
bending angle and dihedral angle, but also distances between points, lines and
planes.</p>

<h3>Auxiliary objects and related functionality<a class="headerlink" href="#auxiliary-objects-and-related-functionality" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A Zeobuilder model consists of much more than just atoms and bonds. In figure 7,
an example is displayed that contains three reference frames (each containing a
molecule), two spring objects that connect two molecules, a Lithium atom, and a
user-defined rotation axis.</p>
<div align="center" class="figure">
<img alt="_images/zeobuilder_align.png" src="_images/zeobuilder_align.png" />
<p class="caption">Figure 7: The alignment of several molecules is facilitated by rotation
axes and spring objects.</p>
</div>
<p>A few basic concepts are explained in the following items:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The selected reference frames are surrounded by a wire-framed box.</li>
<li>At the origin of each reference frame, the X, Y and Z axes are visualized in
red, green and blue color respectively. This also applies to the global
reference frame.</li>
<li>The reference frames (and their contents) can be individually rotated and
translated. Each transformation can be performed interactively in the 3D view,
or numerically by entering the transformation parameters. In both cases, one
can define assisting objects in the model, e.g. one can connect two atoms to
define a rotation axis.</li>
<li>Springs (with a predefined rest length) facilitate the alignment of molecules
or molecular building blocks. Zeobuilder comes with a rigid body optimizer
that tries to find the energy minimum for these springs as a function of the
translation and rotation of the molecules.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-connection-scanner-for-zeolite-building-blocks">
<h3>The connection scanner for zeolite building blocks<a class="headerlink" href="#the-connection-scanner-for-zeolite-building-blocks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Several zeolite-oriented tools in Zeobuilder, including the connection scanner,
use a geometrical abstraction of a condensation reaction. This is visualized in
figure 8. The hydrogen atoms are hidden to keep the figure transparent. (a) One
selects certain pairs of oxygen atoms that take part in the condensation
reaction. (b) The spring optimization or the connection scanner translate and
rotate one of the two molecules as to bring each pair of oxygen atoms into
overlap. (c) Each (overlapping) pair is replaced by a single oxygen atom at the
geometrical mean of the two original atoms.</p>
<div align="center" class="figure">
<img alt="_images/condensation.png" src="_images/condensation.png" />
<p class="caption">Figure 8: A schematic overview of the geometrical abstraction of a
condensation reaction in Zeobuilder. See text for more details.</p>
</div>
<p>The connection scanner performs a deterministic search algorithm for all
possible ways to connect two zeolite clusters through a polycondensation
reaction. In order to limit the output to a manageable number of solutions, one
can parameterize the scanner with several limiting factors. First of all, the
connection scanner assumes that the two building blocks are rigid bodies.
Internally the scanner compares triangles formed by terminating oxygen atoms in
both structures. The minimum and maximum sizes of these triangles are important
limiting ingredients. One can also define the mismatch tolerance when comparing
triangles. A large mismatch tolerance will typically generate too many
solutions. Finally a quality cost-function is used to discriminate between
favorable and unrealistic solutions. The output is presented as in figure 9.</p>

<h2>Developer friendly<a class="headerlink" href="#developer-friendly" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>At first instance Zeobuilder will (hopefully) be very helpful in one&#8217;s
day-to-day molecular editing tasks. After a while, one might however imagine
special features that are not implemented yet, but that would be very helpful.
In this perspective Zeobuilder is the number-one framework for the
implementation of dedicated features with a minimal effort. The reasons are
outline below.</p>
<div class="section" id="extensibility">
<h3>Extensibility<a class="headerlink" href="#extensibility" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Zeobuilder is designed to be extended with new features. The program consists of a small core and large amount of plugins. The core program has been kept as minimal as possible, while nearly all visible features of the program are implemented as plugins. These plugins do not interact with each other, so adding a new feature comes down to adding a new plugin. It is not necessary to interfere with the existing code base. Several types of plugins are supported:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>nodes</strong>: New types of objects that make up the molecular model.</li>
<li><strong>actions</strong>: New functionality, e.g. functions in the menu bar or interactive
functions.</li>
<li><strong>load_filters</strong>: New file formats to read from.</li>
<li><strong>dump_filters</strong>: New file formats to write to.</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few other types of plugins that have more technical nature. It is
even possible create new categories of plugins via the plugin framework.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="python">
<h3>Python<a class="headerlink" href="#python" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Zeobuilder is written in <cite>Python &lt;http://www.python.org&gt;</cite>, an easy to learn
general-purpose language. Python rocks! It has given us the possibility to
create a lot of special features that would be far from trivial in any other
programming language. For example, plugins are self-contained python modules
(text files) that can be installed in your home-directory. Compilation is not
required and one can easily exchange plugins via email or web-pages.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="transferability">
<h3>Transferability<a class="headerlink" href="#transferability" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We do our best to implement each feature without making too much assumptions on
how this feature is going to be used. This sounds awkward, but consider the
spring optimization as a nice example. Initially the spring optimization was
only meant to be used for connecting zeolite clusters via the geometerical
abstraction of the condensation reaction. After a while we installed Zeobuilder
on a dedicated desktop machine available to everyone in our research group. It
turned out that the spring optimization was very popular for aligning organic
molecules. This was not planned, but the generic nature of the spring objects
resulted in unexpected applications.</p>
